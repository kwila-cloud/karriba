# Karriba Kickoff Meeting

## Introductions

First Karriba maintainers meeting. Let's get synced up!

## Design Document Discussion

Ideas for future
- Pre-fill selected applicator in a record to match the previous record
- Add fields linked to customers
  - Allow recording field notes (for things like hazards)
- Record dilution applied and pesticide applied as totals, not rates

Color scheme idea - burnt yellow and forest green

## App Skeleton

We should use "Records" instead of "Flights"

## Next Steps

Addison and Julian will work on getting basic form input up and running.

Scheduled next meeting for next week at the same time, but can reschedule if Malachi is busy spraying.
