## Pesticides

- The user will input a predefined list of pesticides, similar to what they do for customers and applicators.
- Each pesticide will have a name and registration number.
- Within each record, the user can input multiple pesticides.
    - The user selects the pesticide from the pre-defined list.
    - The user can add as many pesticides as they need to a single record.
    - The user can enter the rate and rate unit for each pesticide in a record.
    - By default, the rate unit will be "fl oz"
