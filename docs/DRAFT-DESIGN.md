# Design Document: Precision Pesticide Application Tracker

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the design specifications for Precision Pesticide, a mobile application system that enables drone pesticide operators to efficiently record and manage pesticide applications. The solution consists of a Flutter-based mobile frontend for Android tablets and a Python-based backend for data processing and PDF generation. The application will capture all required regulatory data points, generate standardized PDF reports using PyPDF, and operate with minimal internet connectivity in accordance with local-first principles.

## 2. Project Values

The design of Precision Pesticide adheres to the following core values:

**Open Source**: Both the Flutter frontend and Python backend will be fully open source, allowing for community contributions and transparent development. This dual-technology approach leverages the strengths of both ecosystems.

**Data Sovereignty**: Users will maintain complete control over their data, with robust SQLite management including import/export capabilities and no vendor lock-in. The Python backend enhances this capability through flexible data processing.

**Local First**: The application will function offline by default, with local SQLite database management and optional synchronization to servers when connectivity is available.

## 3. User Personas

### Primary User: Drone Pesticide Operator
- Professional who applies pesticides using drone technology
- Requires accurate record-keeping for regulatory compliance
- Often works in remote locations with limited connectivity
- Needs to generate standardized documentation for clients and regulatory bodies
- Uses Android tablets in the field, requiring direct application access without a browser

### Secondary User: Farm Owner/Advisor
- Requires documentation of pesticide applications
- Reviews and retains pesticide application records
- May need to share records with regulatory agencies

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Data Collection Interface

The application must collect the following data points as identified in the Pesticide Record Form:

1. Applicator information
   - Name
   - License number

2. Owner/Advisor information
   - Name
   - Address

3. Owner contact confirmation and REI (Re-Entry Interval) details

4. Treatment details
   - Crop treated
   - Field name and coordinates (GPS)
   - Pesticide name and registration number
   - Application rate
   - Total treated area
   - GPA (Gallons Per Acre)

5. Environmental conditions
   - Wind velocity/direction before application
   - Wind velocity/direction after application
   - Temperature during application

### 4.2 Report Generation

The application must:
- Generate standardized PDF reports using PyPDF matching the format in the Pesticide Record Form

- Allow customization of report headers/footers
- Include timestamp and electronic signature capabilities

### 4.3 Data Management

The application must provide in Phase 1:
- Local storage of all application records using SQLite
- SQLite database import and export functionality
- Search and filter capabilities across all data fields
- Data export in multiple formats (PDF, CSV)

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Technology Stack

The application will utilize a hybrid architecture:

1. **Mobile Frontend (Flutter)**
   - Material Design components for consistent UI
   - Provider or Bloc pattern for state management
