We should allow the user to edit customers, just like they can edit applicators.

## Steps

- [ ] Replace `NewCustomerPage` with `EditCustomerPage` (just like `EditApplicatorPage`)
- [ ] Use `EditCustomerPage` to edit draft customers when the add button is pressed on the customers page (just like the applicators page)
- [ ] Allow the user to tap on an customer to open the `EditCustomerPage`
- [ ] Allow the user to save changes to a customer using `CustomerDao.save` instead of `CustomerDao.insert`
