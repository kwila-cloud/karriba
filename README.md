# Karriba

🚀 **An intuitive commercial drone record-keeping system that keeps getting better**

## 🌍 Our Values

### 🛠 Open Source

Innovation thrives when knowledge is shared. Karriba is, and always will be, **open-source**. If you believe in the project and want to support its growth, consider subscribing to our [cloud service](#cloud-service). Prefer full control? [Self-host](#self-hosted) it instead—your data, your choice.

### 🔓 Data Sovereignty

We believe in **data freedom**—no vendor lock-in, no hidden traps. You control your data from day one. Your drone records should belong to you, not a third-party service.

### 📶 Local-First

Great software should **work offline**. Karriba is designed with **local-first principles**, meaning you can use it even without an internet connection. The Progressive Web App (PWA) syncs your data when you’re online, but remains fully functional offline. Whether you choose our cloud or your own server, the power remains in your hands.

## 🔑 Access

🚧 **Currently in Alpha**: We are actively developing Karriba and working towards a stable release.

The **MVP** will be an offline Android app.

In the long run, you’ll have two ways to sync data between devices.

### ☁️ Cloud Service

We will offer a fully hosted cloud version for users who want hassle-free access.

💰 **Planned pricing:** $100/month

#### 🎁 Subscription Perks

- 🚀 **Priority Support** – Get help when you need it.
- ☁️ **Cloud Access** – Secure and seamless.
- 💡 **Feature Requests Priority** – Your ideas shape the future.

🔓 **Cancel anytime**—many users may only need the service seasonally.

### 🏡 Self-Hosted

Once the cloud service is stable and has paying users, we will provide **self-hosting documentation** so you can run Karriba on your own infrastructure—**always 100% free**.

💡 **Note:** Self-hosted users won’t have access to [paid perks](#subscription-perks), but they will still benefit from a robust open-source tool.
