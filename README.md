# precision-pesticide

A platform for drone pesticide operators to track their pesticide applications and flights.

## Values

### Open Source

The greatest innovation happens when ideas are shared freely. This project is and always will be open-source. You can support the development of the project by paying for our [cloud service](#cloud-service). If that is not a good option for you, try [self-hosting](#self-hosted) instead.

### Data Sovereignty

We hate vendor lock-in. You probablly do to! From the start, we will make control over your own data a priority.

### Local First

Good software should not require constant internet connectivity. In order to achieve this, this project is built from the ground up using local-first techniques. A central server is required to host the PWA (Progressive Web App), but once you have the app installed you can run it entirely without an internet connection. When you want to access your data between different devices, sync your data with our server in the cloud or your own self-hosted server.

## Access

This project is currently in it's alpha stages. Long term, we aim to have two main ways of accessing the software.

### Cloud Service

We aim to run a service which hosts the project in the cloud for convenient access.

To make this sustainable, our target price is $100/month.

#### Paid Perks

This subscription will get you
- Priority support
- Access to the cloud service
- First priority in suggesting new features

You can deactivate your subscription at any time. We expect many operators to only activate their subscription for six months a year.

### Self-hosted

Once we have got the cloud service up and running with paid users, we will add documentation for how to self-host the project on your own servers. This option will always be totally free.

However, please keep in mind you you will not get access to the [paid perks](#paid-perks).

### Needs

- [ ] We need about $5,000 to fund the initial development of this project.
- [ ] We need a good name for the project, one that will be well received in the market.
- [ ] We need alpha testers. People who are willing to try out early iterations of the project even if it is far from complete and sometimes glitchy.

Please contact addison@kwila.cloud if you are interested in helping with any of these needs!
